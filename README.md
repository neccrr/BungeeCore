BungeeCore is an essential plugin for Minecraft Proxy servers. It allows server admins to control the proxy servers.

I personally not recommend this to be used. I make this just for a personal use and this is full of skid and shit codes so use it at your own risk.

## Building
BungeeCore uses Gradle to handle dependencies & building.

#### Requirements
* Java 17 JDK or newer
* Git

#### Compiling from source
```sh
git clone https://github.com/neccrr/BungeeCore
cd BungeeCore/
./gradlew build
```

You can find the output jars in the `build/libs` directories.

## Contributing
#### Pull Requests
If you make any changes or improvements to the plugin which you think would be beneficial to others, please consider making a pull request to merge your changes back into the upstream project.

Generally, try to copy the style of code found in the class you're editing.
